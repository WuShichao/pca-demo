## Principal Component Analysis for Gravitational Wave Time Series Data

Gravitational waves from rotating (axisymmetric) stellar core collapse have a generic morphology that allows efficient decomposition of waveform catalogs with principal component analysis (PMA). This repository contains a Python 3 Jupyter Notebook that shows step-by-step how this is done.
